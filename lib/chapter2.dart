    '=> Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.\n'

    '=> Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.\n'

    '=> Easy-to-maintain − Pythons source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.\n'

    '=> A broad standard library − Pythons bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.\n'

    '=> Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.\n'

    '=> Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.\n'

    '=> Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.\n'

    '=> Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.\n'

    '=> GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.\n'

    '=> Scalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.\n',
